# fic - Fast Image Cycler

## Why and what does it do?
I needed something that lets me very quickly seek through a bunch of images and filemanager previews are not good enough and normal viewing is too slow (especially with big files).  
What this simply does its loading all images in the current selection first so it can quickly display them.  
That also means you can accidentally knock your pc out on ram usage, so keep an eye on that.  
Have a look in the doc folder to get an idea how it looks like.
